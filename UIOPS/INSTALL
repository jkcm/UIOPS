Put the code into one directory, and compile the three CPP files:

mex CGAL_minR.cpp
mex CGAL_EllipseSize.cpp -I/opt/local/include -L/opt/local/lib -lCGAL -lgmp
mex CGAL_RectSize.cpp -I/opt/local/include -L/opt/local/lib -lCGAL -lgmp

Steps to run the code:
1. read_binary()
2. runImgProc()
3. runSizeDist()
