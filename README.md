# UW-particle-phase-classifier: University of Washington Random Forest cloud particle phase classification scheme

This software is currently developed at the University of Washington to classify individual cloud particles as seen by the 2DS probe, using a random forest approach. Inputs to the classifier originate in the UIOPS probe data processing software, and therefore this project was forked from the UIOPS repository to include that code. Any work referencing this project should additionally and separately reference the UIOPS project using the DOI:10.5281/zenodo.3667054.
